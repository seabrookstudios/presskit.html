  <description>
    Here goes a quick description of your product or game. Be concise and explain in very few words the concept or the gameplay and why it's really cool and why everyone should use or play it.
  </description>

  <!--
    Tell the story of your product with the `<history>` tag.

    You have two possibilities here.

    - Use an `<history>` block like in the example.
    - Or use an `<histories>` block if you have tons of things to say.

    You can't have both.

    You can see an example of the `<histories>` block in the company page.

  <history>
    Add some storytelling here. Not the scenario of your game, but rather some backgrounds behind the creation process: why are you making this game? Most projects starts with a cool story.

  <!-- ## About -->

  <!--
    An "About Your Company" section is automatically generated from the content of the company page.

    This <abouts> tag is completely **optional**. If you don't want this section, just delete it. But sometimes, you want to add a description for a partner.

    This is this the place to do it.

    For example, if you have a publisher, you can speak a bit more about it here.

    Most of the time, you should link that to the <partner> tag above, if you want to explain a partner a bit more. But you could use this section for other purpose.

    The <link> tag is optional.
