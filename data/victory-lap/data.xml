    Race with your head. Not with your thumbs. Intense turn-based racing emphasising tactics over twitch. Battle for position and make clever use of your tyres and fuel as you compete against friends and AI.

  <histories>
    <history>
      <text>Victory Lap started life back in late 2017 as a card game. But when I worked out we'd need 2,500 cards to create the game, I pivoted to a hand-crafted spreadsheet.</text>
    </history>
    <history>
      <text>When the spreadsheet proved fun I continued to develop a series of prototypes exploring the visual aspects of the game. What you see now is probably the 9th or 10th prototype and one that has been iterated on over the last 2 years.</text>
    </history>
    <history>
      <text>In 2018 Victory Lap entered early access, over the course of the F1 season the early playtesters would meet to race a circuit designed to match the real circuits. In 2019 we came back and introduced our race week challenge.</text>
    </history>
    <history>
      <text>Victory Lap is still in early access and will remain so until we're satisified we can bring on new players to this new style of racing game.</text>
